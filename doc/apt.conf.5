.TH "APT.CONF" "5" "29 May 2006" "" ""

.SH NAME
apt.conf \- Configuration file for APT
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fIapt.conf\fR is the main configuration file for the APT suite of
tools, all tools make use of the configuration file and a common command line
parser to provide a uniform environment. When an APT tool starts up it will
read the configuration specified by the \fBAPT_CONFIG\fR environment 
variable (if any) and then read the files in Dir::Etc::Parts 
then read the main configuration file specified by 
Dir::Etc::main then finally apply the
command line options to override the configuration directives, possibly 
loading even more config files.
.PP
The configuration file is organized in a tree with options organized into
functional groups. Option specification is given with a double colon
notation, for instance APT::Get::Assume-Yes is an option within 
the APT tool group, for the Get tool. Options do not inherit from their 
parent groups.
.PP
Syntacticly the configuration language is modeled after what the ISC tools
such as bind and dhcp use.  Lines starting with
// are treated as comments (ignored).  Each line is of the form

.nf
APT::Get::Assume-Yes "true";
.fi
The trailing 
semicolon is required and the quotes are optional. A new scope can be
opened with curly braces, like:
.PP

.nf
   
APT {
  Get {
    Assume-Yes "true";
    Fix-Broken "true";
  };
};
.fi
with newlines placed to make it more readable. Lists can be created by 
opening a scope and including a single word enclosed in quotes followed by a 
semicolon. Multiple entries can be included, each separated by a semicolon.
.PP

.nf
   
RPM::Allow-Duplicated {"kernel"; "kernel-smp";};
.fi
.PP
In general the sample configuration file in 
\fI/usr/share/doc/apt/examples/apt.conf\fR \fI/usr/share/doc/apt/examples/configure-index.gz\fR
is a good guide for how it should look.
.PP
Two specials are allowed, #include and #clear\&. 
#include will include the given file, unless the filename
ends in a slash, then the whole directory is included.  
#clear is used to erase a list of names.
.PP
All of the APT tools take a -o option which allows an arbitrary configuration 
directive to be specified on the command line. The syntax is a full option
name (APT::Get::Assume-Yes for instance) followed by an equals
sign then the new value of the option. Lists can be appended too by adding 
a trailing :: to the list name.   
.SH "THE APT GROUP"
.PP
This group of options controls general APT behavior as well as holding the
options for all of the tools.
.TP
\fBArchitecture\fR
System Architecture; sets the architecture to use when fetching files and
parsing package lists. The internal default is the architecture apt was 
compiled for.
.TP
\fBIgnore-Hold\fR
Ignore Held packages; This global option causes the problem resolver to
ignore held packages in its decision making. 
.TP
\fBClean-Installed\fR
Defaults to on. When turned on the autoclean feature will remove any packages
which can no longer be downloaded from the cache. If turned off then
packages that are locally installed are also excluded from cleaning - but
note that APT provides no direct means to reinstall them.
.TP
\fBForce-LoopBreak\fR
Never Enable this option unless you -really- know what you are doing. It
permits APT to temporarily remove an essential package to break a
Conflicts/Conflicts or Conflicts/Pre-Depend loop between two essential
packages. SUCH A LOOP SHOULD NEVER EXIST AND IS A GRAVE BUG. This option 
will work if the essential packages are not gzip, libc, rpm, bash or
anything that those packages depend on.
.TP
\fBCache-Limit\fR
APT uses a fixed size memory mapped cache file to store the 'available'
information. This sets the size of that cache.
.TP
\fBBuild-Essential\fR
Defines which package(s) are considered essential build dependencies.
.TP
\fBGet\fR
The Get subsection controls the \fBapt-get\fR(8) tool, please see its
documentation for more information about the options here.
.TP
\fBCache\fR
The Cache subsection controls the \fBapt-cache\fR(8) tool, please see its
documentation for more information about the options here.
.TP
\fBCDROM\fR
The CDROM subsection controls the \fBapt-cdrom\fR(8) tool, please see its
documentation for more information about the options here.
.SH "THE ACQUIRE GROUP"
.PP
The Acquire group of options controls the download of packages 
and the URI handlers. 
.TP
\fBQueue-Mode\fR
Queuing mode; Queue-Mode can be one of host or 
access which determines how  APT parallelizes outgoing 
connections. host means that one connection per target host 
will be opened, access means that one connection per URI type 
will be opened.
.TP
\fBRetries\fR
Number of retries to perform. If this is non-zero APT will retry failed 
files the given number of times.
.TP
\fBSource-Symlinks\fR
Use symlinks for source archives. If set to true then source archives will
be symlinked when possible instead of copying. True is the default
.TP
\fBhttp\fR
HTTP URIs; http::Proxy is the default http proxy to use. It is in the 
standard form of http://[[user][:pass]@]host[:port]/\&. Per 
host proxies can also be specified by using the form 
http::Proxy::<host> with the special keyword DIRECT 
meaning to use no proxies. The \fBhttp_proxy\fR environment variable
will override all settings.

Three settings are provided for cache control with HTTP/1.1 compliant 
proxy caches. No-Cache tells the proxy to not use its cached 
response under any circumstances, Max-Age is sent only for 
index files and tells the cache to refresh its object if it is older than 
the given number of seconds. Debian updates its index files daily so the 
default is 1 day. No-Store specifies that the cache should never 
store this request, it is only set for archive files. This may be useful 
to prevent polluting a proxy cache with very large .deb files. Note: 
Squid 2.0.2 does not support any of these options.

The option timeout sets the timeout timer used by the method, 
this applies to all things including connection timeout and data timeout.

One setting is provided to control the pipeline depth in cases where the
remote server is not RFC conforming or buggy (such as Squid 2.0.2)
Acquire::http::Pipeline-Depth can be a value from 0 to 5 
indicating how many outstanding requests APT should send. A value of
zero MUST be specified if the remote host does not properly linger
on TCP connections - otherwise data corruption will occur. Hosts which
require this are in violation of RFC 2068.     
.TP
\fBftp\fR
FTP URIs; ftp::Proxy is the default proxy server to use. It is in the 
standard form of ftp://[[user][:pass]@]host[:port]/ and is 
overridden by the \fBftp_proxy\fR environment variable. To use a ftp 
proxy you will have to set the ftp::ProxyLogin script in the 
configuration file. This entry specifies the commands to send to tell 
the proxy server what to connect to. Please see 
\fI/usr/share/doc/apt/examples/configure-index.gz\fR for an example of 
how to do this. The subsitution variables available are 
$(PROXY_USER), $(PROXY_PASS), $(SITE_USER),
$(SITE_PASS), $(SITE), and $(SITE_PORT)\&.
Each is taken from it's respective URI component.

The option timeout sets the timeout timer used by the method, 
this applies to all things including connection timeout and data timeout.

Several settings are provided to control passive mode. Generally it is 
safe to leave passive mode on, it works in nearly every environment. 
However some situations require that passive mode be disabled and port 
mode ftp used instead. This can be done globally, for connections that 
go through a proxy or for a specific host (See the sample config file 
for examples)

It is possible to proxy FTP over HTTP by setting the \fBftp_proxy\fR
environment variable to a http url - see the discussion of the http method
above for syntax. You cannot set this in the configuration file and it is
not recommended to use FTP over HTTP due to its low efficiency.

The setting ForceExtended controls the use of RFC2428 
EPSV and EPRT commands. The defaut is false, which means
these commands are only used if the control connection is IPv6. Setting this
to true forces their use even on IPv4 connections. Note that most FTP servers
do not support RFC2428.
.TP
\fBcdrom\fR
CDROM URIs; the only setting for CDROM URIs is the mount point, 
cdrom::Mount which must be the mount point for the CDROM drive 
as specified in \fI/etc/fstab\fR\&. It is possible to provide 
alternate mount and unmount commands if your mount point cannot be listed 
in the fstab (such as an SMB mount and old mount packages). The syntax 
is to put 

.nf
"/cdrom/"::Mount "foo";
.fi
within 
the cdrom block. It is important to have the trailing slash. Unmount 
commands can be specified using UMount.
.SH "DIRECTORIES"
.PP
The Dir::State section has directories that pertain to local 
state information. lists is the directory to place downloaded 
package lists in.
preferences is the name of the APT preferences file.
Dir::State contains the default directory to prefix on all sub 
items if they do not start with \fI/\fR or \fI\&./\fR\&. 
.PP
Dir::Cache contains locations pertaining to local cache 
information, such as the two package caches srcpkgcache and 
pkgcache as well as the location to place downloaded archives, 
Dir::Cache::archives\&. Generation of caches can be turned off
by setting their names to be blank. This will slow down startup but
save disk space. It is probably prefered to turn off the pkgcache rather
than the srcpkgcache. Like Dir::State the default
directory is contained in Dir::Cache
.PP
Dir::Etc contains the location of configuration files, 
sourcelist gives the location of the sourcelist and 
main is the default configuration file (setting has no effect,
unless it is done from the config file specified by 
\fBAPT_CONFIG\fR).
.PP
The Dir::Parts setting reads in all the config fragments in 
lexical order from the directory specified. After this is done then the
main config file is loaded.
.PP
Binary programs are pointed to by Dir::Bin\&. Dir::Bin::Methods 
specifies the location of the method handlers and gzip, 
rpm, apt-get, rpmbuild
and apt-cache specify the location
of the respective programs.
.SH "HOW APT CALLS RPM"
.PP
Several configuration directives control how APT invokes \fBrpm\fR(8)\&. These are 
in the RPM section.
.TP
\fBOptions\fR
This is a list of options to pass to rpm for all install, upgrade and
remove operations. The options must be specified
using the list notation and each list item is passed as a single argument
to \fBrpm\fR(8)\&.
.TP
\fBInstall-Options\fR
This is a list of options to pass to rpm during install and upgrade
operations. The options must be specified
using the list notation and each list item is passed as a single argument
to \fBrpm\fR(8)\&.
.TP
\fBErase-Options\fR
This is a list of options to pass to rpm during remove operations. 
The options must be specified
using the list notation and each list item is passed as a single argument
to \fBrpm\fR(8)\&.
.TP
\fBPre-Invoke\fR
.TP
\fBPost-Invoke\fR
This is a list of shell commands to run before/after invoking \fBrpm\fR(8)\&. 
Like Options this must be specified in list notation. The 
commands are invoked in order using \fI/bin/sh\fR, should any 
fail APT will abort.
.TP
\fBPre-Install-Pkgs\fR
This is a list of shell commands to run before invoking rpm. Like
Options this must be specified in list notation. The commands
are invoked in order using \fI/bin/sh\fR, should any fail APT 
will abort. APT will pass to the commands on standard input the 
filenames of all .rpm files it is going to install, one per line.

Version 2 of this protocol dumps more information, including the 
protocol version, the APT configuration space and the packages, files
and versions being changed. Version 2 is enabled by setting 
DPkg::Tools::Options::cmd::Version to 2. cmd is a
command given to Pre-Install-Pkgs\&.
.TP
\fBRun-Directory\fR
APT chdirs to this directory before invoking rpm, the default is 
\fI/\fR\&.
.TP
\fBBuild-Options\fR
These options are passed to \fBrpmbuild\fR(1) when compiling packages.
.SH "DEBUG OPTIONS"
.PP
Most of the options in the debug section are not interesting to 
the normal user, however Debug::pkgProblemResolver shows 
interesting output about the decisions dist-upgrade makes. 
Debug::NoLocking disables file locking so APT can do some 
operations as non-root and Debug::pkgRPMPM will print out the 
command line for each rpm invokation. Debug::IdentCdrom will 
disable the inclusion of statfs data in CDROM IDs.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
\fI/usr/share/doc/apt/examples/configure-index.gz\fR contains a 
sample configuration file showing the default values for all possible 
options.
.SH "FILES"
.PP
\fI/etc/apt/apt.conf\fR
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBapt-cache\fR(8), \fBapt-config\fR(8), \fBapt_preferences\fR(5)\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Reporting bugs in APT-RPM is best done in the 
APT-RPM mailinglist <URL:http://apt-rpm.org/mailinglist.shtml>\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
Maintainer and contributor information can be found in the
credits page <URL:http://apt-rpm.org/about.shtml> of APT-RPM.
