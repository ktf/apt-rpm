APT-RPM supports translation of filenames to package names internally
since version 0.5.15cnc3, but filenames must be in the pkglists for
the internal version to work. It means that to access all files in the
system pkglists must be built with --bloat, so using this script is
still an option.

What is apt-files?
------------------

This is a simple APT-RPM plugin allowing one to pass any
filename for apt-get, like:

    apt-get install /etc/rc.d/init.d/myservice

or

    apt-get install /usr/bin/lua


How to use it?
--------------

First, you must create a "database" with the "filename -> pkgname" map.
This database is a simple compressed text file with one "filename pkgname"
pair per line, with a space separating them. For example:

    /usr/bin/lua lua
    /usr/bin/apt-get apt-get
    ...

You can create these files from an hdlist or from a directory full of
rpm files using the convert.py program (you'll need the rpm python
module).

After you created the database, you can install the plugin putting
these files in the following directories:

    /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/apt-files.conf
    /usr/share/apt/scripts/apt-files.lua
    /var/state/apt/Contents.gz

Bingo! It should be working. ;-)
